Diving Beet
===========

Diving Beet is a port of [Falling
Turnip](https://github.com/tranma/falling-turnip) from Haskell to
[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org) and Python.

Usage
-----

Just `make run`, although you'll need the Futhark compiler installed.
You can insert particles by left-clicking, although you can't
overwrite anything that's already there.  Right-click to delete
particles.  Use the left/right arrow keys to select the particle to
insert, and the scroll wheel to control the modification radius.
